# Programing Fundamentals
This repo houses my work, as I work through of the workbook assoicated with Edinburgh Napier Programing Fundamentals [SET07109]. 
After working through the workbook I then completed the assoicated exercises in the exercise book and the exercises within the workbook itself. 
Stand alone exercises are stored in the Exercise folder, while everything else can be found in the week by week folders.

The start of the notebook looks at C, before moving onto C++. Enjoy.
